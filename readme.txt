README

For running: Run the program from the bin folder with following command
	java CS310.searchMap ../input.txt ../output.txt
	
JUnit:
	My tests pass when I run them through eclipse. I spoke with Professor Chang and he said that
	it might be because we are using a different version of JUnit than provided in my eclispe. 
	He said not to worry about it. If you would like to see my tests pass on my local machine,
	I can show you in person. Thanks!
